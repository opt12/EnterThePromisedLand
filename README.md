For all of you who reant to dig deeper, I strongly recommend:
* For a first scratch at the surface, but worth reading:   
Parker, Daniel: JavaScript with promises,   
ISBN: 9781449373214, http://proquest.tech.safaribooksonline.de/9781491930779

And for those who want to really dive into all the JS stuff there is this excellent series by Kyle Simpson:  
* You don't know JS; https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS
* and for Promises of course this volume is of special interest:
